<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>How to telll so much about yourself while even you are not sure what you like.</p>

<p>I'm 15-years-old introvert girl. I love coding so much that even AI will be replaced with me after 10 years, I spend my 15-yrs-old summer with learning how to code. I love how I can create with a few knowledge of code. So I'm a creative, learner. I obviously love art. I'm fascinated by brush touches since I'm not afraid of using them, freely. I hope I will touch some hearts, laugh, travel, volunteer and of course, the meaning of my life, create as much as I can.</p>
<p>Sincerly</p>
